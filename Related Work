    In this chapter, we review and contextualize existing research and studies related to the impact and application
of design patterns in software development. Understanding the broader landscape of design patterns research provides
a foundation for our own investigation and offers insights into the evolving trends within the field.

    1. Historical Context of Design Patterns:
    To comprehend the trajectory of design patterns in software engineering, it is crucial to delve into the
historical evolution of this concept. The seminal work of the "Gang of Four" (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson,
and John Vlissides) laid the groundwork for the formalization of design patterns in their influential book, "Design
Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" also written by "Gang of Four".

    2. Studies on Clean Coding Principles:
    Several studies have explored the relationship between design patterns and clean coding principles. Notable
research in this domain has investigated how the application of design patterns contributes to code readability,
maintainability, and overall adherence to clean coding standards. This line of work aligns with our interest in
understanding the impact of design patterns on code cleanliness.

    Conclusion:
    This chapter concludes by synthesizing the key findings from related work and positioning our study within the
broader context of design patterns research. By critically examining previous studies, we lay the groundwork for our
unique contribution to the field, emphasizing how our investigation extends existing knowledge and addresses specific
gaps in the current literature. (Still needs some more research)
